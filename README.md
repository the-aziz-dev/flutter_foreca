# Simple Foreca Weather app

The Foreca app is a simple weather app that shows us the weather condition base on our location. In this application, we have used the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API. We fetch weather condition data from OpenWeatherMap by the [HTTP](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package, and With the [Geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) package, we work with GPS mobile and can find our current location. Finally, based on our location, we determine which data should come from OpenWeatherMap.

To use this source, you must register on OpenWeatherMap and get your ApiKey, then replace your API key with my expired API key :)

I was able to implement this application after watching [Angela Yu's](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/?referralCode=2B7724A180C0502A2547) course.
